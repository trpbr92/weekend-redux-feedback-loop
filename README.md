# Project Name
Weekend Redux Feeback Loop

## Description

For this project I created an app that allows users to submit feedback based on how they are feeling, their understanding, are they being supported, and lastly a page where they submit any comments they would like. Feeling, understanding and support and all submited by the user based on a 1-5 scale. There is a review page at that compiles all of the users inputs and allows the users to review their responses before submitting. Upon submitting, the user feedback is sent and stored in a database.

## Technologies used:

- React
